# Computer-Security-Final-Project

Group Number: Group 5
Group Members: Yuwen Sang, Garret Sugarbaker, Benjamin Luppen
Project Name: Nacho Average Educational Computer Security Tower Defence

Project Description:
We are making a tower defense style game focused on teaching computer security attacks and security measures and preventions. 
The player will be faced with waves of enemies and have to build up defenses in order to prevent enemies from reaching their objective. 
Enemies will employ cyber security attacks covered in class to inhibit the playerâ€™s defenses and make navigating the menus difficult. 
The player will have specifically tailored options to counteract each of these attacks. 
The game will be single-player and introduce more complexity with each level. Enemies will be based on waves.
